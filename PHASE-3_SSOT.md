PHASE-3 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (SSOT)
============================================================

This document IS the definitive authority for Phase-3 implementation.
No Phase-3 implementation SHALL occur outside this document.
Blueprints are reference-only and SHALL NOT override this SSOT.

============================================================
SSOT GLOBAL LAWS (LOCKED — PERMANENT)
============================================================

- Phase-2 admin actions SHALL continue to work as defined

**LAW 4: Event ≠ State Separation**
- Meetings, match attempts, engagements, marriages, payments are EVENTS
- Draft, Active, Suspended, Archived are STATES
- Events SHALL NOT directly mutate states unless explicitly governed
- State transitions SHALL be intentional and governed, not automatic consequences of events

**LAW 5: Authority Order (Global — Non-Negotiable)**
Admin > User > Matchmaker > OCR/System

This order SHALL be respected:

**LAW 8: Field Identity & Data Integrity**
- Once a field exists and stores data:
  - Its semantic meaning SHALL NOT change
  - Its type SHALL NOT be reinterpreted
  - Historical values SHALL NOT be re-evaluated
- Field evolution is allowed ONLY by:
  - Adding a NEW field
  - NEVER by redefining an existing field

**LAW 9: Governance Structures Only (No Executable Business Logic)**

============================================================
PHASE-3 SCOPE DECLARATION (FOUNDATION ONLY)
============================================================

Phase-3 builds GOVERNANCE FOUNDATIONS ONLY.

**Phase-3 MUST NOT:**
- Implement AI logic
- Implement OCR engines
- Implement automation workflows
- Implement payment systems
- Implement WhatsApp or messaging
- Decide scoring or matching logic
- Change Phase-2 behavior

**Phase-3 ONLY DEFINES:**
- Governance structures
- Authority rules
- Conflict handling framework
- Profile lifecycle rules
- Historical data protection
- CORE vs EXTENDED field model
- Field metadata and registry
- Conflict record system

============================================================
CORE vs EXTENDED FIELD MODEL (LOCKED)
============================================================

**CORE Fields:**
- Fixed database schema (columns in `matrimony_profiles` table)
- Used by search algorithms, filters, matching logic
- Required by Flutter/Web app UI components
- Cannot be created or deleted by admin at runtime
- Changes require code modification + app release
- Examples: `full_name`, `gender`, `date_of_birth`, `marital_status`, `education`, `location`, `caste`, `height_cm`, `profile_photo`
- Governance: Managed via code migrations and app updates only

**EXTENDED Fields:**
- Admin-creatable at runtime (no code changes required)
- Stored as key-value pairs (JSON or separate `profile_extended_fields` table)
- No hard dependency in app logic (search, matching, filters)
- Rendered as passive "Additional Information" sections
- Can be enabled/disabled without breaking app functionality
- Examples: `property_details`, `children_info`, `medical_conditions`, `family_notes`, `preferences`, `hobbies`
- Governance: Managed via admin UI, stored separately from CORE fields

**Separation Principle:**
- CORE fields = App-critical, schema-bound, migration-controlled
- EXTENDED fields = Contextual, runtime-managed, app-agnostic

============================================================
OCR & BIODATA GOVERNANCE (STRICT)
============================================================

**MODE 1: FIRST PROFILE CREATION (Biodata-based Registration)**
- OCR MAY populate ALL fields (CORE and EXTENDED) at first profile creation
- No manual approval required at this stage
- Profile SHALL be marked as "OCR-created" (conceptual flag)
- Goal: Manual data entry = 0

**MODE 2: EXISTING PROFILE + NEW BIODATA UPLOAD**
- OCR SHALL evaluate field-by-field:
  - For CORE fields:
    - If field is EMPTY → OCR auto-fill is ALLOWED
    - If field EXISTS and value is SAME → Ignore
    - If field EXISTS and value is DIFFERENT → Create Conflict Record (NO auto-overwrite)
  - For EXTENDED fields:
    - If field does NOT exist → Auto-create & auto-fill allowed
    - If field exists with different value → Create Conflict Record (approval required)

**MODE 3: POST-HUMAN-EDIT LOCK STATE**
- If a CORE or EXTENDED field has been edited by User/Admin/Matchmaker:
  - Field SHALL be considered LOCKED
  - OCR MAY suggest changes but SHALL NOT overwrite automatically
  - Admin retains override authority (per authority order)

**GOVERNANCE RULES:**
- OCR SHALL NEVER silently overwrite existing data
- Any mismatch between existing data and new data MUST create a Conflict Record
- OCR auto-fills CORE fields during first profile creation and for missing fields only
- Overwriting existing CORE fields SHALL ALWAYS require human approval

============================================================
CONFLICT RECORD (MANDATORY ENTITY)
============================================================

Every conflict MUST be stored as a persistent object containing:

**Required Fields:**
- `id` (primary key)
- `profile_id` (foreign key to matrimony_profiles)
- `field_name` (string, identifies CORE or EXTENDED field)
- `field_type` (enum: 'CORE' or 'EXTENDED')
- `old_value` (text/json, previous value)
- `new_value` (text/json, proposed new value)
- `source` (enum: 'OCR', 'USER', 'ADMIN', 'MATCHMAKER', 'SYSTEM')
- `detected_at` (timestamp)
- `resolution_status` (enum: 'PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED', 'OVERRIDDEN')
- `resolved_by` (nullable, foreign key to users, identifies authority)
- `resolved_at` (nullable timestamp)
- `resolution_reason` (nullable text)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (timestamp)

**Conflict Record Rules:**
- Conflicts SHALL be auditable and immutable until resolved
- Only resolved conflicts SHALL be modifiable (for audit trail updates)
- Conflict resolution SHALL respect authority order (Admin > User > Matchmaker > OCR/System)
- Conflict Records SHALL NOT be hard-deleted

============================================================
PROFILE FIELD REGISTRY (MANDATORY SYSTEM)
============================================================

**Purpose:**
Central metadata for every profile field (CORE and EXTENDED).

**Required Metadata:**
- `field_key` (string, immutable, unique identifier)
- `field_type` (enum: 'CORE' or 'EXTENDED')
- `data_type` (enum: 'text', 'number', 'date', 'boolean', 'select')
- `is_mandatory` (boolean)
- `is_searchable` (boolean, applies to CORE fields only)
- `is_user_editable` (boolean)
- `is_system_overwritable` (boolean)
- `lock_after_user_edit` (boolean)
- `display_label` (string, mutable, UI-only)
- `display_order` (integer, category-based)
- `category` (string, organizational grouping)
- `is_archived` (boolean, soft delete flag)
- `replaced_by_field` (nullable, foreign key to field_registry, for field replacement)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (timestamp)

**Field Key Immutability:**
- Internal `field_key` SHALL be immutable once introduced
- Display labels SHALL be UI-only and MAY change
- Labels MAY be localized (language-ready)
- AI, OCR, APIs SHALL depend ONLY on `field_key`, never on labels

============================================================
PROFILE LIFECYCLE STATES (CANONICAL)
============================================================

**Defined States:**
- `Draft` — Profile being created, not yet active
- `Active` — Profile is live and searchable
- `Search-Hidden` — Profile exists but hidden from search
- `Suspended` — Profile temporarily disabled
- `Archived` — Profile permanently archived
- `Demo-Hidden` — Demo profile hidden from search (admin-controlled)

**State-Behavior Matrix:**

| State | Editable | Searchable | Interest/Interaction Allowed |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------------------|
| Draft | Yes | No | No |
| Active | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Search-Hidden | Yes | No | Yes |
| Suspended | No | No | No |
| Archived | No | No | No |
| Demo-Hidden | Yes | No | No |

**State Transition Rules:**
- State transitions SHALL be controlled and intentional
- Events (meetings, matches, payments) SHALL NOT automatically change states
- State transitions SHALL require explicit admin or user action
- Profile lifecycle states SHALL be independent of match outcomes

============================================================
HISTORICAL DATA PROTECTION (MANDATORY)
============================================================

**Field Versioning:**
- Field definition changes SHALL be tracked over time
- Historical field configurations SHALL be maintained
- Field replacement workflows SHALL be supported

**Data Preservation:**
- No hard delete of field definitions SHALL occur
- No hard delete of field values SHALL occur
- All historical biodata SHALL be retained
- Archive instead of delete policy SHALL be enforced

**Historical Access:**
- Previous field values SHALL remain accessible through appropriate mechanisms
- Historical values SHALL support audit, disputes, and future learning systems
- Historical data integrity SHALL be maintained regardless of technical implementation

  - The defined functionality is accessible via the intended UI (Admin or User).
  - The functionality can be manually tested without database inspection.
- Features implemented but not accessible via UI
  SHALL be considered INCOMPLETE.
- Admin-only features MUST be verifiable via Admin Panel.
- User-facing features MUST be verifiable via User Panel.
- If verification cannot be performed, the day is NOT complete.

**RULE 11: CURSOR VERIFICATION-ONLY MODE**
- Cursor AI SHALL be used ONLY to inspect actual project files and report factual findings.
- Cursor SHALL NOT:
  - Assume file existence
  - Propose architecture or design
  - Suggest new logic or shortcuts

 ==============================
 नक्की. खाली **फक्त 4 lines मध्ये Day-2 summary** — थेट **SSOT मध्ये add** करता येईल अशी:

---

**Day-2 Summary:**
Admin ला runtime मध्ये **EXTENDED profile fields define करण्याची सुविधा** implement केली.
EXTENDED fields `field_registry` मध्ये metadata म्हणून store केले; `field_key` unique व immutable ठेवला.
`profile_extended_fields` table तयार केली, **cascade delete टाळून historical integrity राखली**.
CORE fields, Phase-2 behavior, OCR, conflicts, dependencies — **कुठलाही extra scope touch केला नाही**.
===================
Date      : 2026-01-29
Day       : Day 3
Status    : ☑️ Completed
------------------------------------------------------------
Admin panel मध्ये EXTENDED fields editable + saveable केले.
Admin profiles list साठी dedicated /admin/profiles page add केला.
Admin list मधील View Profile links user routes ऐवजी admin routes वर fix केले.
Admin → List → Profile navigation end-to-end verify करून lock केला.


------------------------------------------------------------
Day-4 Summary:
Conflict Record System foundation implement केला; conflict_records table व ConflictRecord model SSOT-exact schema सह तयार केला.
Admin साठी read-only list UI दिली व manual conflict creation (testing only) सक्षम केली.
Default resolution_status = PENDING, records immutable ठेवून authority-based resolution पुढील दिवसासाठी defer केली.
OCR, auto-detection, resolution workflow, Phase-2 behavior — काहीही touch केले नाही.
---------------------
Day-5
Conflict Resolution Framework implement करून
authority order (Admin > User > Matchmaker > OCR) strict enforce केला.
Approve / Reject / Override actions audit-safe ठेवून
resolution_reason, resolved_by, resolved_at mandatory केले.
Resolved conflicts immutable ठेवले; profile data mutation जाणीवपूर्वक टाळली.
Decision (conflict record) आणि execution (profile update) वेगळे ठेवण्याचा
governance principle practically समजला.
---------------------------------------
Day-6 मध्ये field locking system पूर्णपणे implement व verify केला.
Human edit (User/Admin) नंतर field lock होतो, पण authority order नुसार legitimate edits allowed आहेत.
Locked fields वर system/OCR overwrite पूर्णपणे blocked आहे; unrelated fields edit safe आहेत.
Admin, User, API सर्व flows मध्ये lock enforcement + Phase-2 behavior intact ठेवून Day-6 formally closed केला.
--------------------------
Day-7 Summary (SSOT):
Profile lifecycle साठी canonical lifecycle_state governance layer implement करून scattered flags वर centralized control enforce केला.
Admin-controlled explicit state transitions (Active, Suspended, Archived, Search-Hidden, Demo-Hidden) lock केले.
Receiver आणि sender दोन्ही बाजूंनी interaction guards (interest, shortlist) lifecycle_state नुसार strict enforce केले.
Phase-2 behavior न मोडता lifecycle governance production-safe पद्धतीने complete केली
------------------------
